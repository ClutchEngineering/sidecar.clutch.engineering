## Frequently Asked Questions

### Are there limitations on OBD2 parameter access for 2025+ model years?

**Yes, 2025 model year and newer Mustang Mach-E vehicles introduced significant ECU encryption that limits diagnostic parameter access.**

Starting with the 2025 model year, Ford added security measures to many of the Mustang Mach-E's Electronic Control Units (ECUs). This restricts the parameters that be read through OBD2.

#### What this means for owners

- **Limited diagnostic data**: Many advanced vehicle parameters that were previously accessible on 2021-2024 models are now encrypted and unavailable through aftermarket OBD2 scanners
- **Reduced monitoring capabilities**: Real-time monitoring of certain powertrain, battery, and system-level metrics may be restricted
- **Standard diagnostics still work**: Basic OBD2 functions like reading standard trouble codes (DTCs) remain accessible

This encryption is part of Ford's broader cybersecurity initiative to protect vehicle systems from unauthorized access, but it does limit the depth of vehicle data available to third-party diagnostic tools and monitoring applications.

The Mach-E includes access to the Ford BlueOval Charge Network and, starting in 2024, Ford provided adapters allowing access to the Tesla Supercharger network for even more convenient charging options.

### Is the Mustang Mach-E compatible with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto?

Yes, all Mustang Mach-E model years support both Apple CarPlay and Android Auto:

**All Model Years (2021-2025):**
- Wireless Apple CarPlay
- Wireless Android Auto
- 15.5-inch portrait-oriented touchscreen (SYNC 4A system)
- Wireless smartphone charging pad (standard on higher configurations, available on base configurations)

The Mach-E's large vertical touchscreen provides an excellent interface for both smartphone integration systems, and the wireless connectivity eliminates the need for cables.
