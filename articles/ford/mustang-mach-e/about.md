# About the Ford Mustang Mach-E

The Ford Mustang Mach-E is an all-electric SUV that combines the iconic Mustang heritage with modern electric vehicle technology. Launched in 2021, the Mach-E is Ford's entry into the electric vehicle market.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Are there limitations on OBD2 parameter access for 2025+ model years?

**Yes, 2025 model year and newer Mustang Mach-E vehicles introduced significant ECU encryption that limits diagnostic parameter access.**

Starting with the 2025 model year, Ford added security measures to many of the Mustang Mach-E's Electronic Control Units (ECUs). This restricts the parameters that be read through OBD2.

#### What this means for owners

- **Limited diagnostic data**: Many advanced vehicle parameters that were previously accessible on 2021-2024 models are now encrypted and unavailable through aftermarket OBD2 scanners
- **Reduced monitoring capabilities**: Real-time monitoring of certain powertrain, battery, and system-level metrics may be restricted
- **Standard diagnostics still work**: Basic OBD2 functions like reading standard trouble codes (DTCs) remain accessible

This encryption is part of Ford's broader cybersecurity initiative to protect vehicle systems from unauthorized access, but it does limit the depth of vehicle data available to third-party diagnostic tools and monitoring applications.

### What is the range of the Mustang Mach-E?

The Mustang Mach-E offers two battery pack options with varying range capabilities:

**Standard Range Battery (68 kWh usable):**
- RWD: Up to 250 miles EPA-estimated range
- AWD: Up to 226 miles EPA-estimated range

**Extended Range Battery (88 kWh usable):**
- RWD: Up to 320 miles EPA-estimated range
- AWD: Up to 290 miles EPA-estimated range

Range varies based on driving conditions, temperature, driving style, and vehicle configuration. Performance-oriented configurations, despite having the larger battery pack, achieve slightly lower range due to their enhanced powertrains.

### How fast can the Mustang Mach-E charge?

The Mustang Mach-E supports both AC and DC fast charging:

**DC Fast Charging:**
- Maximum rate: Up to 150 kW on Extended Range models
- 10-80% charge time: Approximately 38 minutes at peak charging rates
- Uses CCS1 (Combined Charging System) connector

**AC Level 2 Charging:**
- Onboard charger: 11.5 kW (48A)
- 0-100% charge time: Approximately 8-10 hours depending on battery size
- Compatible with standard J1772 connector

The Mach-E includes access to the Ford BlueOval Charge Network and, starting in 2024, Ford provided adapters allowing access to the Tesla Supercharger network for even more convenient charging options.

### Does the Mustang Mach-E support hands-free driving?

Yes, the Mustang Mach-E offers **BlueCruise**, Ford's hands-free highway driving technology. BlueCruise is available on higher configurations.

**BlueCruise capabilities:**

- Hands-free driving on over 130,000 miles of pre-mapped highways in North America (called "Blue Zones")
- Active Driver Monitoring System using a driver-facing camera to ensure attention on the road
- Automatic lane centering and adaptive cruise control
- Available as an optional feature with subscription-based activation

**BlueCruise 1.5** (introduced for 2025 model year):
- Added automatic lane change capability
- Enhanced hands-free features
- Improved driver monitoring

The system requires drivers to remain attentive and ready to take control at all times. BlueCruise typically includes a complimentary trial period with new vehicles, followed by a subscription model.

### Is the Mustang Mach-E compatible with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto?

Yes, all Mustang Mach-E model years support both Apple CarPlay and Android Auto:

**All Model Years (2021-2025):**
- Wireless Apple CarPlay
- Wireless Android Auto
- 15.5-inch portrait-oriented touchscreen (SYNC 4A system)
- Wireless smartphone charging pad (standard on higher configurations, available on base configurations)

The Mach-E's large vertical touchscreen provides an excellent interface for both smartphone integration systems, and the wireless connectivity eliminates the need for cables.
