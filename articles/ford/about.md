# About Ford

Ford Motor Company was founded by Henry Ford on June 16, 1903, in Detroit, Michigan. Ford revolutionized the automotive industry and American manufacturing through the introduction of the moving assembly line in 1913, which dramatically reduced production costs and made automobiles affordable for the average American family.

The Model T, introduced in 1908, became one of the most influential automobiles in history. Produced from 1908 to 1927, over 15 million Model T vehicles were built, transforming personal transportation and establishing Ford as a household name. Henry Ford's vision of mass production democratized automobile ownership and fundamentally changed American society.

Ford's contributions to automotive engineering and manufacturing processes extended well beyond the Model T. The company played a crucial role in supporting Allied forces during World War II, producing military vehicles, aircraft engines, and equipment. Throughout its history, Ford has been synonymous with innovation, durability, and accessibility in the automotive market.
