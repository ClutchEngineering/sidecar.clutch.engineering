# About Lexus

Lexus is the luxury vehicle division of Japanese automaker Toyota Motor Corporation. Launched in the United States on September 1, 1989, Lexus was created to compete directly with established European luxury brands by offering a combination of exceptional quality, refined performance, and superior customer service.

The brand made its debut with the LS 400 flagship sedan, a vehicle that redefined luxury car expectations with its remarkable quietness, build quality, and attention to detail. The LS 400 became an immediate success and established Lexus as a serious competitor to Mercedes-Benz, BMW, and other premium European manufacturers.

From its inception, Lexus pioneered the concept of the luxury automotive dealership experience in America, setting new standards for customer service and satisfaction that influenced the entire industry. This commitment to the customer experience, combined with Toyota's engineering excellence and reliability, became the foundation of the brand's identity.

Lexus has been a leader in hybrid luxury vehicle technology, launching the RX 400h in 2005 as the world's first luxury hybrid SUV. This commitment to electrified powertrains has continued throughout the brand's history, with hybrid options becoming a signature element of the Lexus lineup.
