# About Nissan

Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. was founded in 1933 in Yokohama, Japan, evolving from the merger of several automotive companies including Dat Jidosha Seizo (DAT Motorcar Company). The company's name derives from Nihon Sangyo, meaning "Japan Industries," and it quickly established itself as one of Japan's pioneering automotive manufacturers.

Nissan entered the American market in 1958 with the Datsun brand, initially focusing on small, fuel-efficient vehicles that emphasized reliability and value. The Datsun 510, introduced in 1968, became particularly influential in changing American perceptions of Japanese automobiles through its combination of performance, practicality, and affordability.

The company has been a pioneer in automotive innovation throughout its history. Nissan introduced the first mass-market electric vehicle with the Leaf in 2010, demonstrating a commitment to alternative powertrains. The legendary Skyline GT-R, produced since 1969, established Nissan's performance credentials through dominance in motorsports and engineering excellence. The Nissan Patrol, first introduced in 1951, became one of the world's most durable and capable off-road vehicles, earning a reputation for reliability in the harshest conditions across the Middle East, Africa, and Australia.
