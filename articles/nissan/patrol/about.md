**2010-2023 Model Years:**

The Patrol did **not** come with factory-installed Apple CarPlay or Android Auto support during these model years. However, several aftermarket solutions are available:

- Aftermarket plug-and-play integration modules compatible with 2010-2023 Y62 Patrol models
- Professional installation services can add CarPlay and Android Auto functionality while retaining factory features
- Solutions available for Series 4 and Series 5 Patrol variants (2017-2023)

**Important Note:** For pre-2024 models, verify your specific build date when considering aftermarket upgrades, as internal system changes (particularly in late 2020 and beyond) may affect compatibility with certain integration modules.

The addition of wireless smartphone integration in 2024 brought the Patrol in line with modern connectivity expectations, making it easier to access navigation, music, and communication features while on the road.

### What off-road capabilities does the Nissan Patrol offer?

The Nissan Patrol is engineered for serious off-road performance, with comprehensive capability features that have established its reputation in demanding environments:

**Four-Wheel Drive Systems:**

- **Advanced 4WD system** with electronically controlled transfer case offering high-range and low-range gearing
- Low-range gearing provides enhanced torque multiplication for steep climbs and technical terrain
- Locking rear differential on off-road focused configurations for maximum traction
- Hill Start Assist and Hill Descent Control for confident operation on steep grades

**Terrain Management Technologies:**

- **Intelligent 4x4**: Automatically monitors road conditions and adjusts power distribution between front and rear wheels for optimal traction
- **All-Mode 4x4**: Allows drivers to manually select between 4H (high-range four-wheel drive) and 4L (low-range) modes depending on terrain
- Multiple terrain modes optimize throttle response, transmission shift patterns, and traction control for different surfaces

**Suspension and Ground Clearance:**

- **Adaptive Air Suspension**: Available system provides multiple height settings, raising ground clearance for off-road obstacles or lowering for easier entry/exit and highway aerodynamics
- Ground clearance: Up to 244mm (9.6 inches) depending on configuration and suspension setting
- Independent front suspension with solid rear axle provides excellent wheel articulation and durability
- Heavy-duty shock absorbers designed for punishment on rough terrain

**Structural Advantages:**

- **Body-on-frame construction**: Traditional truck-based architecture provides exceptional durability and resistance to frame flex during extreme articulation
- Reinforced chassis members and underbody protection on off-road configurations
- Approach, departure, and breakover angles optimized for obstacle clearance

**Technology Aids:**

- **360-degree camera system**: Provides comprehensive visibility around the vehicle, particularly valuable when navigating tight trails or rocky terrain
- **Sonar-based parking sensors**: Help detect obstacles in challenging conditions
- **Differential locks and traction control**: Work together to maintain momentum in loose or slippery conditions

The Patrol's combination of mechanical capability, electronic driver aids, and robust construction makes it one of the most capable factory off-road vehicles available, equally at home crossing deserts, climbing mountain trails, or navigating deep sand.

### What is the towing capacity of the Nissan Patrol?

The Nissan Patrol offers robust towing capability suitable for serious recreational and commercial applications. Actual towing capacity varies by market, configuration, and equipment.

**Important Considerations:**

When towing at or near maximum capacity, available payload for occupants and cargo is significantly reduced. The combined weight of passengers, luggage, and equipment can quickly consume available payload capacity, so careful planning is essential when towing heavy trailers with a fully loaded vehicle.

**Towing Features and Equipment:**

- **Integrated trailer brake controller**: Manages electric trailer brakes for smooth, controlled stopping
- **Trailer Sway Control**: Automatically applies individual brakes and reduces engine power if trailer sway is detected, helping maintain stability
- **Tow/Haul mode**: Adjusts transmission shift patterns and throttle response for optimal performance when towing heavy loads
- **Reversing camera with trajectory lines**: Helps align the vehicle with trailers during hitching

The Patrol's substantial torque output from its turbocharged engines, combined with body-on-frame construction and comprehensive towing features, makes it well-suited for towing large travel trailers, boat trailers, horse floats, and equipment trailers.

Always consult your owner's manual for specific towing and payload capacities for your market and configuration.

### What kind of fuel economy does the Nissan Patrol get?

Fuel economy in the Nissan Patrol varies significantly between generations and engine configurations:

**2025 Model Year (Y63 - Twin-Turbo V6):**

The new turbocharged engines are expected to deliver improved fuel efficiency compared to the previous V8, though official EPA-style ratings are not yet widely published for all markets:

- **3.5L Twin-Turbo V6**: Anticipated to achieve approximately 12-14L/100km (17-20 MPG) combined in real-world driving, with better efficiency than the outgoing V8 while delivering more power
- **3.8L Naturally Aspirated V6**: Expected to achieve similar or slightly better fuel economy than the 3.5L turbo, approximately 11-13L/100km (18-21 MPG) combined

**Note:** Actual fuel economy will vary based on driving conditions, load, terrain, and driving style. The Patrol's large size, substantial weight, and four-wheel-drive system inherently limit fuel efficiency compared to smaller SUVs.

**2010-2024 Model Year (Y62 - V8):**

- **5.6L V8**: Typically achieves approximately 14-16L/100km (15-17 MPG) in combined driving conditions
- City driving: 16-18L/100km (13-15 MPG)
- Highway driving: 11-13L/100km (18-21 MPG)

Real-world fuel consumption often exceeds these figures, particularly when:
- Towing heavy trailers
- Operating in off-road conditions with low-range gearing engaged
- Driving in stop-and-go urban traffic
- Using four-wheel-drive modes on paved roads
- Carrying heavy loads approaching maximum payload

**Fuel Economy Optimization Tips:**

- Use 2WD (rear-wheel drive) mode on paved roads when conditions permit
- Maintain proper tire pressures (under-inflated tires increase rolling resistance)
- Remove roof racks and accessories when not needed to reduce aerodynamic drag
- Use cruise control on highways to maintain consistent speeds
- Ensure regular maintenance including clean air filters and proper engine tuning

**Fuel Tank Capacity:**

The Patrol features a large fuel tank (typically 140 liters / 37 gallons depending on market) providing extended range between fill-ups, particularly valuable for remote travel where fuel stations may be hundreds of kilometers apart.

While the Patrol will never be considered fuel-efficient by modern standards, the improved powertrains in the 2025 model represent meaningful progress in reducing consumption while increasing performance. Prospective buyers should budget for higher fuel costs compared to smaller SUVs or crossovers.
