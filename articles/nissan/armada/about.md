# About the Nissan Armada

The Nissan Armada is a full-size SUV that combines powerful capability, spacious seating for up to eight passengers, and advanced technology. First introduced in 2004, the Armada has become Nissan's flagship SUV offering for North American families who need serious towing capacity and interior space. The completely redesigned third-generation 2025 Armada represents a significant evolution, transitioning from the traditional V8 engine to a more powerful and efficient twin-turbocharged V6, while maintaining the rugged body-on-frame construction that full-size SUV buyers expect.

### What engine does the Nissan Armada have?

The 2025 Nissan Armada features an all-new **twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter V6 engine** producing 425 horsepower at 5,600 rpm and 516 lb-ft of torque at 3,600 rpm. This represents a significant upgrade from the previous generation's naturally aspirated 5.6-liter V8, which produced 390 horsepower and 394 lb-ft of torque.

The new engine is paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission, replacing the previous 7-speed. The twin-turbo V6 delivers more power and torque than the outgoing V8 while offering improved fuel efficiency and a more refined driving experience.

**EPA fuel economy estimates:**
- 2WD models: 16 city / 20 highway MPG
- 4WD models (SV, SL, Platinum, Platinum Reserve): 16 city / 19 highway MPG
- PRO-4X: 15 city / 18 highway MPG

The turbocharged powerplant provides strong low-end torque that's particularly beneficial for towing and off-road situations, while the improved efficiency makes the large SUV more practical for daily driving.

### What is the towing capacity of the Nissan Armada?

The Nissan Armada offers competitive towing capability for the full-size SUV segment, making it well-suited for hauling boats, trailers, and recreational vehicles. Actual capacity varies by configuration and equipment.

**Standard towing equipment includes:**
- Class IV tow hitch
- 7-pin wiring harness
- Trailer sway control

**PRO-4X and Platinum Reserve trims add:**
- Integrated trailer brake controller for improved braking control when towing
- Tow/Haul mode for optimized transmission shift patterns

The combination of substantial torque from the twin-turbo V6, body-on-frame construction, and available four-wheel drive makes the Armada well-suited for towing heavy loads. The available Intelligent 4x4 system with seven drive modes (including a dedicated Tow mode) helps maintain stability and control while hauling trailers.

Consult your owner's manual for specific towing capacities for your configuration.

### Does the Nissan Armada support Apple CarPlay and Android Auto?

Apple CarPlay and Android Auto support varies by generation and model year:

**2025 Third Generation:**
- **Wireless** Apple CarPlay and Android Auto
- Standard across all trim levels (SV through Platinum Reserve)
- 12.3-inch touchscreen standard (14.3-inch on Platinum Reserve)
- Wireless smartphone charging available on upper trims

**2021-2024 Second Generation:**
- **Wired** Apple CarPlay and Android Auto (USB connection required)
- Standard on all trims starting with 2021 model year
- 12.3-inch touchscreen replaced the previous 8.0-inch system in 2021

**2017-2020 Second Generation:**
- No factory Apple CarPlay or Android Auto support
- Aftermarket modules and adapters available to add functionality
- These plug-and-play solutions typically cost $300-600

**2004-2015 First Generation:**
- No smartphone integration support
- Aftermarket head unit replacement required for CarPlay/Android Auto

The addition of wireless smartphone integration for 2025 is a significant upgrade, eliminating the need to connect cables every time you enter the vehicle. Combined with the available wireless charging pad, it creates a truly cable-free experience.

### Does the Armada come with four-wheel drive?

Four-wheel drive availability depends on the trim level:

**Intelligent 4x4 (optional on most trims):**
Available as an option on SV, SL, Platinum, and Platinum Reserve trims. These models come standard with rear-wheel drive.

**Standard 4WD:**
The PRO-4X trim comes exclusively with four-wheel drive and cannot be ordered with rear-wheel drive.

**Intelligent 4x4 features:**
- Seven drive modes: Standard, Eco, Sport, Snow, Sand, Mud/Rut, and Tow
- Electronic locking rear differential (PRO-4X)
- Hill start assist and hill descent control
- Active brake limited slip

The Intelligent 4x4 system can send up to 50% of available torque to the front wheels when needed, while maintaining a rear-biased setup for improved handling and fuel economy during normal driving. The PRO-4X adds Bilstein off-road shocks, skid plates, and all-terrain tires for enhanced off-road capability.

For buyers who primarily drive on paved roads and don't frequently encounter snow or off-road conditions, the rear-wheel drive configuration offers slightly better fuel economy (1 MPG improvement on the highway). However, families in areas with winter weather or those who tow frequently should strongly consider the 4WD option.

### How reliable is the Nissan Armada?

The Nissan Armada has above-average reliability, earning a **3.5 out of 5.0 rating from RepairPal** and ranking **2nd out of 14** in the full-size SUV category.

**Key reliability metrics:**
- Average annual repair cost: $550 (compared to $784 segment average)
- Lower than average repair frequency
- Lower than average severity of repairs

Consumer Reports rates the Armada with about average predicted reliability based on Nissan's overall brand performance and data from previous model years. The 2025 model's all-new design means long-term reliability data is not yet available, but the underlying platform (shared with the Nissan Patrol sold globally) has a proven track record.

**Historical reliability strengths:**
- The second-generation Armada (2017-2024) based on the Nissan Patrol platform has generally demonstrated solid reliability
- The 5.6-liter V8 used from 2017-2024 was a proven, durable engine
- Body-on-frame construction tends to be more robust and easier to repair than unibody designs

**2025 considerations:**
The all-new twin-turbo V6 engine and 9-speed transmission are new to the Armada, so first-year ownership experiences are still emerging. Nissan's standard warranty coverage includes 3 years/36,000 miles basic and 5 years/60,000 miles powertrain protection.

### Does the Nissan Armada offer hands-free highway driving?

Yes, the 2025 Nissan Armada Platinum Reserve trim offers **ProPILOT Assist 2.1**, which provides hands-free highway driving capability on compatible roads. This is Nissan's most advanced driver assistance system and is one of the few true hands-free systems available in the full-size SUV segment.

**ProPILOT Assist 2.1 capabilities:**

**Hands-free driving:**
- Allows hands-off operation on pre-mapped highways when conditions permit
- Driver monitoring system uses infrared camera to ensure driver attentiveness
- System will alert driver to resume control when necessary
- Only functions on highways that have been mapped by Nissan

**Active lane management:**
- Lane centering and adaptive cruise control in all conditions
- Can suggest lane changes to help drivers avoid camping in the passing lane
- Executes lane changes with a tap of the turn signal (driver must keep hands on wheel during lane changes)

**Traffic jam assist:**
- Handles stop-and-go traffic autonomously
- Maintains safe following distance
- Can bring vehicle to complete stop and resume automatically

**Important requirements and limitations:**
- Requires active NissanConnect Services subscription (trial period included with purchase)
- Only available on Platinum Reserve trim
- Hands-free operation limited to compatible highways (expanding coverage)
- Driver must remain attentive and ready to take control at any time
- Not a fully autonomous system

Lower trim levels come with standard ProPILOT Assist (hands-on system), which provides adaptive cruise control and lane centering but requires continuous steering wheel contact. The SV, SL, Platinum, and PRO-4X trims can be upgraded to ProPILOT Assist 1.1, which adds more sophisticated features but still requires hands on the wheel.

For buyers seeking true hands-free highway driving capability similar to GM's Super Cruise or Ford's BlueCruise, the Platinum Reserve with ProPILOT Assist 2.1 is the only Armada option that delivers this functionality.

### What is the seating capacity of the Nissan Armada?

The Nissan Armada seats **seven or eight passengers** depending on the second-row configuration:

**Eight-passenger configuration:**
- Front bucket seats
- Second-row bench seat (3-passenger)
- Third-row bench seat (3-passenger)
- Standard on SV and SL trims

**Seven-passenger configuration:**
- Front bucket seats
- Second-row captain's chairs (2-passenger)
- Third-row bench seat (3-passenger)
- Available on SL, Platinum, PRO-4X, and Platinum Reserve
- Standard on Platinum Reserve

**Interior dimensions:**
- First-row headroom: 41.0 inches
- Second-row headroom: 39.9 inches
- Third-row headroom: 37.2 inches
- First-row legroom: 41.9 inches
- Second-row legroom: 39.1 inches
- Third-row legroom: 31.4 inches

**Cargo capacity:**
- Behind third row: 16.5 cubic feet
- Behind second row: 49.9 cubic feet
- Behind first row: 95.4 cubic feet

The power-folding third-row seats (standard on SL and above) make it easy to maximize cargo space when you don't need all three rows. The second-row bench or captain's chairs can also fold flat to create a massive cargo area for larger items.

The Armada's spacious interior is one of its key advantages over smaller three-row SUVs like the Nissan Pathfinder. Adults can comfortably sit in all three rows for extended trips, and the wide-opening rear doors make third-row access easier than many competitors.
