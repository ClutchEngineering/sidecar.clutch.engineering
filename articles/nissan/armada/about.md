# About the Nissan Armada

The Nissan Armada is a full-size SUV that combines powerful capability, spacious seating for up to eight passengers, and advanced technology. First introduced in 2004, the Armada has become Nissan's flagship SUV offering for North American families who need serious towing capacity and interior space. The completely redesigned third-generation 2025 Armada represents a significant evolution, transitioning from the traditional V8 engine to a more powerful and efficient twin-turbocharged V6, while maintaining the rugged body-on-frame construction that full-size SUV buyers expect.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What engine does the Nissan Armada have?

The 2025 Nissan Armada features an all-new **twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter V6 engine** producing 425 horsepower at 5,600 rpm and 516 lb-ft of torque at 3,600 rpm. This represents a significant upgrade from the previous generation's naturally aspirated 5.6-liter V8, which produced 390 horsepower and 394 lb-ft of torque.

The new engine is paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission, replacing the previous 7-speed. The twin-turbo V6 delivers more power and torque than the outgoing V8 while offering improved fuel efficiency and a more refined driving experience.

**EPA fuel economy estimates:**
- 2WD models: 16 city / 20 highway MPG
- 4WD models (most configurations): 16 city / 19 highway MPG
- Off-road configurations: 15 city / 18 highway MPG

The turbocharged powerplant provides strong low-end torque that's particularly beneficial for towing and off-road situations, while the improved efficiency makes the large SUV more practical for daily driving.

### What is the towing capacity of the Nissan Armada?

The Nissan Armada offers competitive towing capability for the full-size SUV segment, making it well-suited for hauling boats, trailers, and recreational vehicles. Actual capacity varies by configuration and equipment.

**Standard towing equipment includes:**
- Class IV tow hitch
- 7-pin wiring harness
- Trailer sway control

**Higher configurations add:**
- Integrated trailer brake controller for improved braking control when towing
- Tow/Haul mode for optimized transmission shift patterns

The combination of substantial torque from the twin-turbo V6, body-on-frame construction, and available four-wheel drive makes the Armada well-suited for towing heavy loads. The available Intelligent 4x4 system with seven drive modes (including a dedicated Tow mode) helps maintain stability and control while hauling trailers.

Consult your owner's manual for specific towing capacities for your configuration.

### Does the Armada come with four-wheel drive?

Four-wheel drive availability depends on the configuration:

**Intelligent 4x4 (optional on most configurations):**
Available as an option on most configurations. These models come standard with rear-wheel drive.

**Standard 4WD:**
Off-road configurations come exclusively with four-wheel drive and cannot be ordered with rear-wheel drive.

**Intelligent 4x4 features:**
- Seven drive modes: Standard, Eco, Sport, Snow, Sand, Mud/Rut, and Tow
- Electronic locking rear differential on off-road configurations
- Hill start assist and hill descent control
- Active brake limited slip

The Intelligent 4x4 system can send up to 50% of available torque to the front wheels when needed, while maintaining a rear-biased setup for improved handling and fuel economy during normal driving. Off-road configurations add Bilstein off-road shocks, skid plates, and all-terrain tires for enhanced off-road capability.

For buyers who primarily drive on paved roads and don't frequently encounter snow or off-road conditions, the rear-wheel drive configuration offers slightly better fuel economy (1 MPG improvement on the highway). However, families in areas with winter weather or those who tow frequently should strongly consider the 4WD option.

### What is the seating capacity of the Nissan Armada?

The Nissan Armada seats **seven or eight passengers** depending on the second-row configuration:

**Eight-passenger configuration:**
- Front bucket seats
- Second-row bench seat (3-passenger)
- Third-row bench seat (3-passenger)
- Standard on base configurations

**Seven-passenger configuration:**
- Front bucket seats
- Second-row captain's chairs (2-passenger)
- Third-row bench seat (3-passenger)
- Available on most configurations
- Standard on highest configuration

**Interior dimensions:**
- First-row headroom: 41.0 inches
- Second-row headroom: 39.9 inches
- Third-row headroom: 37.2 inches
- First-row legroom: 41.9 inches
- Second-row legroom: 39.1 inches
- Third-row legroom: 31.4 inches

**Cargo capacity:**
- Behind third row: 16.5 cubic feet
- Behind second row: 49.9 cubic feet
- Behind first row: 95.4 cubic feet

The power-folding third-row seats (standard on higher configurations) make it easy to maximize cargo space when you don't need all three rows. The second-row bench or captain's chairs can also fold flat to create a massive cargo area for larger items.

The Armada's spacious interior is one of its key advantages over smaller three-row SUVs like the Nissan Pathfinder. Adults can comfortably sit in all three rows for extended trips, and the wide-opening rear doors make third-row access easier than many competitors.
