# About the Saab 9-5

The Saab 9-5 was Saab's flagship executive car that replaced the Saab 9000 in 1997. The vehicle represented Saab's entry into the premium executive sedan market and competed with cars like the BMW 5 Series, Audi A6, and Mercedes-Benz E-Class.

## Design Philosophy

The 9-5 embodied Saab's commitment to safety, performance, and practical Scandinavian design. It featured distinctive styling elements that set it apart from its competitors, including:

- Aircraft-inspired dashboard design with logical instrument placement
- Center console-mounted ignition switch (a Saab trademark)
- Night panel feature for reduced distraction during night driving
- Active head restraints for whiplash protection

## Engine Options

The 9-5 was available exclusively with turbocharged engines, staying true to Saab's turbocharged heritage. Engine options ranged from economical 2.0-liter four-cylinders to powerful 3.0-liter V6 engines, with various states of tune offering between 150 to 260 horsepower.

## Legacy

The first-generation 9-5 had a remarkably long production run of 12 years (1997-2009), receiving two significant facelifts during its lifetime. The second generation, launched in 2010, was critically acclaimed but had a tragically short production life due to Saab's bankruptcy, making it one of the rarest modern production vehicles.
