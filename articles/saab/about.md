# About Saab

Saab Automobile AB was a Swedish car manufacturer that was founded in 1945 when its parent company, Saab AB, began a project to design a small automobile. The first production model, the Saab 92, was launched in 1949. In 1968, the parent company merged with Scania-Vabis, forming Saab-Scania, which was later renamed to just Saab AB. The car division was then named Saab Automobile.

Saab was known for its innovative approach to automobile design and safety. The company pioneered several safety features that later became industry standards, including headlight washers, heated seats, and active head restraints. Saab vehicles were particularly popular among engineers, architects, and other professionals who appreciated the brand's commitment to functionality and design.

The company's aircraft heritage was evident in many design elements, including the wraparound windshield, the center-console mounted ignition switch (inspired by aircraft ignition placement), and the night panel feature that dimmed all non-essential gauges to reduce distraction during night driving.

In 2000, General Motors took full ownership of Saab Automobile, but the brand struggled financially. Despite several attempts at restructuring, Saab declared bankruptcy in 2011, and production ceased in 2014. The brand's legacy continues to be celebrated by enthusiasts worldwide who appreciate Saab's unique approach to automotive engineering and design.
