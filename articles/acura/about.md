# About Acura

Acura is the luxury vehicle division of Japanese automaker Honda Motor Company. Launched in the United States and Canada on March 27, 1986, Acura was the first Japanese automotive luxury brand, predating Toyota's Lexus and Nissan's Infiniti by several years.

## History and Innovation

The Acura brand was created to offer American consumers a premium alternative to European luxury cars, combining Honda's legendary reliability and engineering excellence with upscale features and performance. The original lineup consisted of the Legend sedan and Integra sport compact, both of which quickly became benchmarks in their respective segments.

Throughout the 1990s, Acura established itself as a leader in automotive technology and performance. The NSX supercar, launched in 1990, became the world's first all-aluminum production car and demonstrated that exotic performance could coexist with everyday usability and reliability. The brand's "Precision Crafted Performance" motto reflected its commitment to engineering excellence.

## Modern Era

In 2006, Acura introduced its distinctive "Power Plenum" grille design, marking a new design language for the brand. The company has since evolved this design philosophy with the current "Diamond Pentagon" grille, which appears across the entire lineup.

Acura continues to pioneer advanced technologies, including:
- **Super Handling All-Wheel Drive (SH-AWD)**: An intelligent torque-vectoring AWD system that enhances handling dynamics
- **AcuraWatch**: A comprehensive suite of advanced safety and driver-assistive technologies
- **Precision Cockpit**: A driver-focused interior design philosophy emphasizing ergonomics and intuitive controls
- **ELS Studio 3D Audio**: Premium audio systems developed in partnership with Grammy-winning recording engineer Elliot Scheiner

## Racing Heritage

Acura has a rich motorsports heritage, particularly in North American road racing. The brand has achieved numerous victories in IMSA sports car racing, winning multiple manufacturer and driver championships. This racing success directly influences the development of production vehicles, with technologies and lessons learned on the track making their way into consumer models.

Today, Acura continues to blend performance, luxury, and advanced technology, staying true to its founding mission of delivering precision crafted performance vehicles that offer an engaging driving experience backed by Honda's renowned reliability and quality.
