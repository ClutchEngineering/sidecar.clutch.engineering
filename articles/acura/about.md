# About Acura

Acura is the luxury vehicle division of Japanese automaker Honda Motor Company. Launched in the United States and Canada on March 27, 1986, Acura was the first Japanese automotive luxury brand, predating Toyota's Lexus and Nissan's Infiniti by several years.

The Acura brand was created to offer American consumers a premium alternative to European luxury cars, combining Honda's legendary reliability and engineering excellence with upscale features and performance. The original lineup consisted of the Legend sedan and Integra sport compact, both of which quickly became benchmarks in their respective segments.

Throughout the 1990s, Acura established itself as a leader in automotive technology and performance. The NSX supercar, launched in 1990, became the world's first all-aluminum production car and demonstrated that exotic performance could coexist with everyday usability and reliability.

Acura has a rich motorsports heritage, particularly in North American road racing. The brand achieved numerous victories in IMSA sports car racing, winning multiple manufacturer and driver championships throughout its history.
