# About the Acura TLX

The Acura TLX is a mid-size luxury sedan that combines sophisticated styling, advanced technology, and engaging performance in a practical package. Introduced in 2014 as a replacement for both the TL and TSX sedans, the TLX represents Acura's vision of the modern sports sedan.

## Design Philosophy

The TLX embodies Acura's "Precision Crafted Performance" ethos, featuring the brand's signature Diamond Pentagon grille and Jewel Eye LED headlights. The exterior design strikes a balance between athletic stance and elegant proportions, with sculpted lines that emphasize the car's dynamic character while maintaining a refined luxury appearance.

The interior showcases Acura's Precision Cockpit design, which prioritizes driver engagement through thoughtful ergonomics and intuitive controls. Premium materials, including available open-pore wood trim and Milano leather seating, create an upscale cabin environment.

## Performance and Technology

### Powertrain Options

The TLX has been offered with several powertrain configurations throughout its production:

- **2.4L 4-cylinder**: The base engine offering a balance of efficiency and performance
- **3.5L V6**: A naturally aspirated engine providing smooth, linear power delivery
- **2.0L Turbocharged 4-cylinder**: Available in second-generation models, offering strong torque and efficiency
- **3.0L Turbocharged V6**: The Type S performance variant delivers 355 horsepower and 354 lb-ft of torque

### Super Handling All-Wheel Drive (SH-AWD)

One of the TLX's standout features is Acura's available Super Handling All-Wheel Drive system. Unlike conventional AWD systems, SH-AWD can actively transfer torque side-to-side and front-to-rear, enhancing handling dynamics and cornering performance. The system can send up to 70% of power to the rear wheels and distribute it asymmetrically between the left and right rear wheels for improved agility.

### Advanced Safety Features

The TLX comes equipped with AcuraWatch, a comprehensive suite of advanced safety and driver-assistive technologies including:

- Collision Mitigation Braking System (CMBS)
- Road Departure Mitigation System (RDM)
- Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC)
- Lane Keeping Assist System (LKAS)
- Traffic Sign Recognition
- Blind Spot Information System (BSI)

## Type S Performance Variant

The TLX Type S, reintroduced with the second generation, represents the pinnacle of the TLX lineup. It features:

- 3.0L turbocharged V6 engine producing 355 hp
- Sport-tuned SH-AWD with increased rear torque bias
- Brembo high-performance brakes
- Adaptive dampers for enhanced handling
- Exclusive styling elements including unique grille, wheels, and quad exhaust outlets

## Technology and Connectivity

Modern TLX models feature Acura's True Touchpad Interface, which uses absolute positioning to mirror the screen layout, making it easier to select functions without looking away from the road. The available ELS Studio 3D premium audio system, designed in collaboration with Grammy-winning engineer Elliot Scheiner, delivers exceptional sound quality with carefully positioned speakers throughout the cabin.

The TLX also offers wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration, a head-up display, and a suite of connected services through AcuraLink.

## Market Position

The TLX competes in the competitive mid-size luxury sedan segment against rivals like the BMW 3 Series, Mercedes-Benz C-Class, Audi A4, and Lexus IS. It distinguishes itself through a combination of reliability, advanced technology, standard features, and competitive pricing, while maintaining the engaging driving dynamics that have historically defined Acura products.
