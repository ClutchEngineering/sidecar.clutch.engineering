# About Volvo

Volvo Car Corporation was founded in 1927 in Gothenburg, Sweden, with a focus on safety, quality, and durability. The company's name derives from the Latin word "volvere," meaning "to roll," and Volvo has established itself as a premium automotive manufacturer known for Scandinavian design and engineering excellence.

Volvo pioneered numerous automotive safety innovations that became industry standards. In 1959, Volvo engineer Nils Bohlin invented the three-point safety belt, which the company made freely available to other manufacturers, prioritizing human safety over profit. This decision exemplified Volvo's commitment to safety that has defined the brand for decades.

The company has produced several iconic vehicles throughout its history. The Volvo 240 series, produced from 1974 to 1993, became synonymous with durability and safety, with many examples still on the road today. The P1800 sports car, manufactured from 1961 to 1973, demonstrated Volvo's capability in crafting elegant, long-lasting vehicles and gained worldwide recognition.
