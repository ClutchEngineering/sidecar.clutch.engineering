# About Ram

Ram Trucks became a standalone brand within the Chrysler Group (now Stellantis) in 2009, separating from Dodge to focus exclusively on pickup trucks and commercial vehicles. The Ram brand traces its heritage to 1981 when Dodge introduced the first Ram pickup, named after the ram hood ornament that had been a Dodge symbol since the 1930s.

The separation into a dedicated truck brand allowed Ram to focus entirely on truck development, competing more directly with Ford's F-Series and Chevrolet's Silverado. This strategic decision enabled Ram to develop truck-specific innovations and features without balancing car and truck development priorities.

Throughout its history, Ram has been known for introducing industry-first features in the full-size truck segment, including the pioneering use of coil spring rear suspension for improved ride quality in 2009, and the introduction of available air suspension systems. The brand has established itself as a major player in the American full-size pickup truck market, known for capability, comfort, and towing capacity.
