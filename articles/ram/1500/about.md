### Are there limitations on OBD2 access for the Ram 1500?

Yes, Ram 1500 trucks from 2018 onward have a Security Gateway Module (SGW) that restricts certain types of OBD2 diagnostic access.

**What's Restricted:**
- The Security Gateway Module was introduced in 2018 to protect the vehicle's network from unauthorized access through the 4G cellular connection in the infotainment system
- Basic OBD2 scan tools can still read standard diagnostic trouble codes and engine parameters
- Advanced diagnostic tools that write to or reprogram the vehicle's ECU are blocked without authorization

**Why It Exists:**
- The SGW creates a security barrier to prevent unauthorized access to the vehicle's computer systems
- Protects the vehicle's CAN network in case the cellular-connected infotainment system is compromised
- Maintains vehicle security while still allowing basic diagnostic access

**Working with the Restriction:**
- Standard OBD2 readers for checking engine codes work normally
- Professional diagnostic tools authorized by Stellantis (Ram's parent company) can access all systems
- Aftermarket bypass modules are available for enthusiasts and independent repair shops, though installing them reduces the vehicle's network security

This security feature is standard across Stellantis vehicles from 2018 forward, including all Ram trucks, and represents the industry's response to increasing vehicle connectivity and cybersecurity concerns.
