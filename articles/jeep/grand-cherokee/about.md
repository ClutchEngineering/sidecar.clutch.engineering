### Are there limitations on OBD2 diagnostic access for the Jeep Grand Cherokee?

**Yes, 2018 and newer Jeep Grand Cherokee models feature a Security Gateway Module (SGW) that restricts certain OBD2 diagnostic functions.**

Starting with select 2017 model year vehicles (introduced as 2018 models) and nearly all 2020+ model years, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (now Stellantis) implemented a Security Gateway Module designed to protect the vehicle's CAN bus network from unauthorized access and potential cybersecurity threats.

#### What this means for owners

- **Basic diagnostics still work**: Reading diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs), viewing ECU information, and monitoring live data streams remain accessible through standard OBD2 scanners
- **Restricted functions**: Clearing fault codes, performing bi-directional controls (actuator tests, calibrations, relearns), and advanced diagnostics require authorized tools with SGW access
- **Professional tools needed**: Mechanics and advanced users need tools with AutoAuth registration (annual subscription service) or physical bypass devices to access restricted diagnostic functions

#### Why this was implemented

According to FCA/Stellantis, the Security Gateway Module protects vehicles from being compromised over cellular networks and prevents unauthorized access to critical vehicle control systems. While this enhances vehicle security, it does limit the depth of diagnostic access available to aftermarket OBD2 tools and monitoring applications.

For Sidecar users, basic OBD2 monitoring functions remain fully accessible on all Grand Cherokee model years, including real-time data monitoring and standard diagnostic code reading.
