# About Chrysler

Chrysler was founded by Walter P. Chrysler on June 6, 1925, when the Maxwell Motor Company was reorganized into the Chrysler Corporation. The company's first vehicle, the Chrysler Six, launched in 1924 and became known for providing customers with advanced engineering and well-built quality at an affordable price, selling over 32,000 units in its first year.

In 1928, Chrysler acquired Dodge Brothers, establishing itself as one of Detroit's "Big Three" automakers alongside Ford and General Motors. This acquisition significantly expanded Chrysler's manufacturing capabilities and market presence.

Throughout its history, Chrysler has introduced several iconic nameplates that have defined American automotive culture, including the Airflow, Imperial, New Yorker, 300, and Town & Country. The Chrysler brand has been synonymous with innovation, distinctive design, and engineering excellence in the American automotive landscape.
