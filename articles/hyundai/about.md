# About Hyundai

Hyundai Motor Company was founded by Chung Ju-Yung on December 29, 1967, in Seoul, South Korea. The company began as a construction firm before entering the automotive industry, initially assembling Ford vehicles under license. In 1975, Hyundai introduced its first independently designed car, the Pony, marking the beginning of the company's evolution into a global automaker.

Hyundai entered the United States market in 1986 with the Excel, an affordable compact car that quickly gained popularity. While early models faced quality challenges, the company invested heavily in engineering and manufacturing improvements throughout the 1990s and 2000s, transforming its reputation from a budget brand to a manufacturer of high-quality, well-equipped vehicles.

The company's commitment to quality improvement was exemplified by the introduction of its industry-leading 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranty in 1999, demonstrating confidence in vehicle durability. Hyundai has since become one of the world's largest automotive manufacturers, known for value, design innovation, and comprehensive warranty coverage.
