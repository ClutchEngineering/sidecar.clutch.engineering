### What is the range of the IONIQ 5?

The IONIQ 5 offers two battery pack options with varying range capabilities depending on the model year:

**2025+ Model Year (Refreshed):**

- **Standard Range Battery (63 kWh, 58 kWh usable):**
  - RWD: Up to 245 miles EPA-estimated range

- **Extended Range Battery (84 kWh, 77.4 kWh usable):**
  - RWD: Up to 318 miles EPA-estimated range
  - AWD: Up to 290 miles EPA-estimated range (SEL/Limited trims)
  - AWD XRT: 259 miles EPA-estimated range

**2022-2024 Model Years:**

- **Standard Range Battery (58 kWh usable):**
  - RWD: 220 miles EPA-estimated range

- **Long Range Battery (77.4 kWh usable):**
  - RWD: Up to 303 miles EPA-estimated range
  - AWD: Up to 256 miles EPA-estimated range

Range varies based on driving conditions, temperature, driving style, vehicle configuration, and terrain. Performance-oriented models like the XRT and N variants achieve lower range due to their enhanced powertrains and larger wheels.

### How fast can the IONIQ 5 charge?

The IONIQ 5 is one of the fastest-charging electric vehicles available, thanks to its innovative 800-volt electrical architecture:

**DC Fast Charging:**
- Maximum rate: Up to 235 kW on Extended Range models
- 10-80% charge time: Approximately 18 minutes at peak charging rates (on 350 kW chargers)
- Uses CCS1 (Combined Charging System) connector on 2024 and earlier models
- 2025+ models feature native NACS (Tesla-style) connector
- Supports both 400-volt and 800-volt charging infrastructure
- Can add approximately 60 miles of range in just 5 minutes

**AC Level 2 Charging:**
- Onboard charger: 11 kW
- 0-100% charge time: Approximately 7-8 hours (Extended Range battery)
- Compatible with standard J1772 connector

**Important Note on Tesla Supercharger Performance:**
While 2025+ IONIQ 5 models can charge at Tesla Superchargers with the built-in NACS port (and older models can use a free adapter provided by Hyundai), charging speeds are limited to approximately 126 kW on Tesla's network due to voltage differences between the IONIQ 5's 800-volt system and Tesla's 400-volt Superchargers.

### Does the IONIQ 5 support wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto?

Support for wireless smartphone integration varies by model year:

**2025+ Model Year:**
- **Wireless** Apple CarPlay
- **Wireless** Android Auto
- Standard across all trim levels
- Dual 12.3-inch displays (digital instrument cluster and touchscreen)
- Wireless smartphone charging pad (standard on SEL and above)

**2022-2024 Model Years:**
- **Wired-only** Apple CarPlay (USB-A connection required)
- **Wired-only** Android Auto (USB-A connection required)
- Aftermarket wireless adapters can be purchased to add wireless functionality

If wireless connectivity is important to you, the 2025 model year represents a significant upgrade with native wireless support for both platforms.

### Does the IONIQ 5 offer hands-free highway driving?

The IONIQ 5 features **Highway Driving Assist 2 (HDA2)**, but it is **not a hands-free system**. HDA2 is a hands-on advanced driver assistance system that requires active driver supervision.

**HDA2 capabilities:**

- Lane centering with adaptive cruise control on highways
- Stop-and-go traffic support in highway situations
- Lane Following Assist (LFA) for maintaining position within lane markings
- Automatic lane change: Tap the turn signal and the system will change lanes while you keep your hands on the wheel
- Requires continuous steering wheel contact with periodic torque inputs to confirm driver attentiveness

**Important limitations:**

- HDA2 only activates on navigation-recognized highways
- Driver monitoring system requires hands on the wheel at all times
- Frequent alerts if steering wheel contact is not detected
- System will deactivate if driver does not respond to warnings

Unlike Ford BlueCruise or GM Super Cruise, HDA2 does not permit hands-free operation. Hyundai does offer a true hands-free system called Highway Driving Pilot in South Korea, but it is not currently available in the U.S. market.

### What is Vehicle-to-Load (V2L) and does the IONIQ 5 have it?

Yes, the IONIQ 5 was one of the first mass-market electric vehicles to feature **Vehicle-to-Load (V2L)** capability, allowing the vehicle to function as a mobile power source.

**V2L specifications:**

- Power output: 3.6 kW (3,600 watts)
- Two available outlets:
  - Interior outlet: Located under the second-row seats for powering devices inside the vehicle
  - Exterior outlet: Located at the charging port (requires V2L adapter) for external equipment
- Voltage options: 110V or 220V depending on region
- Can power household appliances, power tools, camping equipment, and more

**Real-world applications:**

- Emergency backup power for homes during outages (can run essential appliances for extended periods)
- Camping and outdoor activities (powering cooking equipment, lights, portable refrigerators)
- Jobsite power supply for tools and equipment
- Tailgating and events
- Charging other electric vehicles

The IONIQ 5's large battery pack combined with V2L makes it incredibly versatile beyond just transportation. Hyundai has demonstrated the capability by powering a remote Norwegian reindeer farm for three days using only the IONIQ 5's battery.

**Future V2G (Vehicle-to-Grid):**
While currently only V2L is available in the U.S., the IONIQ 5 has the hardware capability for bidirectional Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) charging, which would allow it to send power back to the electrical grid. This technology is being piloted in select European markets.

### Can the IONIQ 5 use Tesla Superchargers?

Yes, the IONIQ 5 has access to Tesla's Supercharger network, though the implementation varies by model year:

**2025+ Model Year:**
- Native **NACS (North American Charging Standard)** port built-in from the factory
- Direct access to Tesla Superchargers without any adapter
- Also compatible with CCS chargers using a CCS-to-NACS adapter

**2024 and Earlier Model Years:**
- CCS1 charging port standard
- Free NACS adapter provided by Hyundai to eligible owners (purchased or leased before January 31, 2025)
- Adapter enables access to over 20,000 Tesla Supercharger locations across the U.S.
- Owners must have an active MyHyundai account to receive adapter redemption instructions

**Charging speed considerations:**
When using Tesla Superchargers, the IONIQ 5 experiences reduced charging speeds compared to high-power CCS chargers like Electrify America. Testing shows peak rates around 126 kW on Tesla's network versus up to 235 kW on 350 kW CCS chargers. This limitation exists because Tesla Superchargers operate at 400 volts while the IONIQ 5's battery system is optimized for 800-volt charging.

For fastest charging speeds, use Electrify America, EVgo, or other CCS high-power charging networks. Tesla Superchargers remain excellent for convenience and network coverage.
