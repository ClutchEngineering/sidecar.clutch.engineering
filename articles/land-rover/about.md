# About Land Rover

Land Rover was founded in 1948 by the Rover Company in Solihull, England. The original Land Rover Series I was designed as a versatile farm and utility vehicle, inspired by the American Jeep. With its aluminum body panels, four-wheel drive system, and rugged construction, the Land Rover quickly became essential transportation in challenging environments worldwide.

The Land Rover brand established a legendary reputation for off-road capability and durability. Vehicles were used extensively by military forces, aid organizations, and explorers in some of the world's most demanding terrain. The Range Rover, introduced in 1970, pioneered the concept of the luxury SUV by combining off-road capability with refined on-road comfort and upscale appointments.

Throughout its history, Land Rover has been synonymous with adventure, exploration, and uncompromising capability. The brand's vehicles have traversed deserts, jungles, and polar regions, earning a reputation for reliability in extreme conditions. The Defender, which entered production in 1983 under that name, became an automotive icon representing the ultimate expression of utilitarian four-wheel-drive engineering.
