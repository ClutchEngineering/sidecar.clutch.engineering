**All Model Years (2021-2025):**

### Is the Volkswagen ID.4 eligible for the federal EV tax credit?

**No, the 2025 Volkswagen ID.4 is NOT currently eligible for the $7,500 federal EV tax credit.**

As of January 2025, the ID.4 was removed from the federal tax credit eligibility list under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The vehicle no longer meets the increasingly stringent requirements related to battery component sourcing and raw material origins designed to support domestic manufacturing.

**Alternative Incentives:**

**Lease Bonus:**
Qualified customers can receive a **$7,500 EV Lease Bonus** when leasing a new 2025 Volkswagen ID.4 through Volkswagen Financial Services. Leasing remains an attractive option to capture this incentive.

**State and Local Incentives:**
Depending on your location, you may be eligible for additional state or local incentives:
- California residents may qualify for up to $10,500 in total incentives through state and utility programs
- Many states and utilities offer additional rebates, reduced registration fees, or HOV lane access
- Check with your state energy office and local utility for available programs

**Important Note:**
The federal tax credit eligibility can change as manufacturers adjust supply chains and battery sourcing. Check the current IRS qualified vehicle list at the time of purchase for the most up-to-date information. Even though new 2024 models may still be available on dealer lots, they are not eligible for the credit if delivered in 2025.

### Does the Volkswagen ID.4 offer bidirectional charging or Vehicle-to-Load capability?

Currently, the Volkswagen ID.4 sold in the U.S. market **does not offer Vehicle-to-Load (V2L)** or bidirectional charging capabilities in its standard configuration, unlike some competitors such as the Hyundai IONIQ 5 or Ford F-150 Lightning.

**Current Capabilities:**
- Standard unidirectional charging only (grid-to-vehicle)
- No built-in capability to power external devices from the vehicle's battery
- No vehicle-to-home (V2H) or vehicle-to-grid (V2G) functionality

**Future Potential:**
Volkswagen has indicated that the MEB platform has the hardware capability to support bidirectional charging, and some ID.4 models in European markets have been used in V2G pilot programs. However, Volkswagen has not announced plans to enable this feature for U.S.-market ID.4 vehicles through software updates or future model years.

**Charging External Devices:**
While the ID.4 cannot power external equipment like some competitors, it does feature:
- Four USB-C charging ports (two charge-and-data, two charge-only)
- Wireless smartphone charging pad
- Standard 12V power outlet

For buyers prioritizing vehicle-to-load capability for camping, emergency backup power, or other applications, vehicles like the Hyundai IONIQ 5, Ford F-150 Lightning, or Rivian R1T/R1S may be more suitable alternatives.
