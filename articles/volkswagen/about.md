# About Volkswagen

Volkswagen was founded in 1937 in Wolfsburg, Germany, with the mission to produce an affordable "people's car" (Volkswagen in German). The company's origins are tied to Ferdinand Porsche's design for a small, economical vehicle that could accommodate a family and be accessible to average workers.

The Volkswagen Beetle, originally known as the Type 1, became one of the most iconic and best-selling automobiles in history. Production began in 1938 and continued for decades, with over 21 million units manufactured worldwide. The Beetle's air-cooled rear engine, distinctive rounded design, and reputation for reliability made it a cultural phenomenon, particularly in the United States during the 1960s.

Volkswagen expanded its model range significantly throughout the 1970s. The Golf, introduced in 1974 as a modern front-engine, front-wheel-drive hatchback, replaced the Beetle as the company's primary product and established a new benchmark for compact car design. The Golf became one of the world's best-selling vehicles and remains a cornerstone of Volkswagen's lineup.
