# About Honda

Honda Motor Company was founded by Soichiro Honda on September 24, 1948, in Hamamatsu, Japan. The company began as a manufacturer of motorized bicycles and motorcycles before expanding into automobile production in the 1960s. Honda's engineering philosophy emphasizes innovation, reliability, and efficiency.

The company entered the American automotive market in 1970 with the Honda 600 sedan, followed by the Civic in 1973. The Civic, introduced during the oil crisis, quickly gained popularity for its exceptional fuel efficiency and reliability, establishing Honda's reputation in the United States. The Accord, launched in 1976, further solidified Honda's position as a major automaker.

Honda's engineering achievements include the development of CVCC (Compound Vortex Controlled Combustion) engine technology in the 1970s, which met strict emissions standards without requiring a catalytic converter. The company has maintained a strong focus on engineering excellence, earning a reputation for building vehicles known for their longevity, fuel efficiency, and low ownership costs.
