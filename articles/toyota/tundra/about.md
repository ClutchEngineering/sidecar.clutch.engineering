# About the Toyota Tundra

The Toyota Tundra is a full-size pickup truck that has been competing in the American truck market since its introduction in 1999. Built in San Antonio, Texas, the Tundra represents Toyota's commitment to the full-size truck segment, offering the brand's legendary reliability in a capable workhorse designed for both professional and recreational use. For the 2022 model year, Toyota introduced an all-new third-generation Tundra featuring twin-turbocharged V6 engines (including Toyota's first hybrid powertrain in a Tundra) that replaced the previous V8, modern technology, and significantly improved towing capacity. The 2025 Tundra continues this evolution, earning the prestigious IIHS Top Safety Pick+ award and offering seven distinct trim levels ranging from the work-focused SR to the ultra-luxurious Capstone.

### What engine options are available for the Toyota Tundra?

The 2025 Toyota Tundra offers two versions of Toyota's innovative twin-turbocharged 3.4L V6 engine, replacing the previous-generation V8 engines with more efficient and powerful forced-induction technology.

**i-FORCE 3.4L Twin-Turbo V6 (Standard):**
- Output: 389 horsepower and 479 lb-ft of torque
- 10-speed automatic transmission
- Available on: SR, SR5, Limited, Platinum, 1794 Edition
- Maximum towing capacity: Up to 12,000 pounds when properly equipped
- Maximum payload capacity: Up to 1,940 pounds

**i-FORCE MAX 3.4L Twin-Turbo V6 Hybrid:**
- Combined output: 437 horsepower and 583 lb-ft of torque
- Pairs the 3.4L twin-turbo V6 with an electric motor integrated into the 10-speed automatic transmission
- Nickel-metal hydride battery pack provides additional power and regenerative braking

### What is the towing capacity of the Toyota Tundra?

The Toyota Tundra offers impressive towing capability that positions it competitively in the full-size truck segment:

**Maximum Towing Capacity:**

- **i-FORCE V6 (Non-hybrid)**: Up to **12,000 pounds** when properly equipped with the right configuration and available Max Tow Package
- **i-FORCE MAX Hybrid**: Up to **11,450 pounds** when properly equipped

**Maximum Payload Capacity:**

- **i-FORCE V6 (Non-hybrid)**: Up to **1,940 pounds**
- **i-FORCE MAX Hybrid**: Up to **1,680 pounds**

**Key Towing Features:**

The Tundra includes several advanced technologies to make towing easier and safer:

- **Integrated Trailer Brake Controller**: Built-in brake controller for trailers with electric brakes, adjustable from the touchscreen
- **Trailer Sway Control**: Detects trailer sway and applies braking to individual wheels to maintain stability
- **Tow/Haul Mode**: Optimizes transmission shift points and throttle response for hauling heavy loads
- **Available Tow Mirrors**: Power-folding, heated mirrors with integrated turn signals extend for better visibility when towing
- **Multi-Terrain Monitor**: Provides surround-view camera coverage to navigate tight spaces with a trailer attached (available on higher trims)

**Important Note**: Actual towing capacity depends on your specific configuration, including cab style, drivetrain (2WD vs. 4WD), trim level, and optional equipment. Always consult your owner's manual and ensure your vehicle is properly equipped with appropriate hitches, wiring, and the available Max Tow Package when maximum towing capacity is needed.

The Tundra's combination of powerful engines and robust construction makes it a capable towing platform, though it falls slightly short of segment leaders like the Ford F-150 (up to 14,000 pounds) and RAM 1500 (up to 12,750 pounds).

### What kind of fuel economy does the Toyota Tundra get?

Fuel economy for the 2025 Toyota Tundra varies based on powertrain and drivetrain configuration:

**i-FORCE 3.4L Twin-Turbo V6 (Non-Hybrid):**
- 2WD: 18 city / 24 highway / 20 combined MPG
- 4WD: 17 city / 22 highway / 19 combined MPG

**i-FORCE MAX 3.4L Hybrid (Most Trims):**
- 2WD: 20 city / 24 highway / 22 combined MPG
- 4WD Limited/Platinum/1794/Capstone: 19 city / 22 highway / 21 combined MPG

**i-FORCE MAX Hybrid (TRD Pro):**
- 4WD: 18 city / 20 highway / 19 combined MPG (lower due to off-road-oriented gearing and all-terrain tires)

The i-FORCE MAX hybrid powertrain provides the most significant fuel economy improvement in city driving, where the electric motor can assist the gasoline engine and recapture energy through regenerative braking. Highway fuel economy is similar between hybrid and non-hybrid versions, with the primary benefit of the hybrid being enhanced torque and power delivery rather than dramatic highway efficiency gains.

For comparison, the Tundra's fuel economy is competitive with other full-size trucks like the Ford F-150 (varying from 17-25 MPG combined depending on engine) and Chevrolet Silverado (16-23 MPG combined), though diesel options from competitors can achieve better highway mileage.

### How reliable is the Toyota Tundra?

The Toyota Tundra has historically been known for exceptional reliability, though the current third-generation model (2022-2025) is still establishing its long-term reliability track record.

**RepairPal Rating:** The Tundra earns a **3.5 out of 5.0 rating from RepairPal**, ranking **6th out of 17** in the full-size truck category, which RepairPal describes as "Above Average."

**Key Reliability Metrics:**
- Average annual repair cost: $606 (below the full-size truck average of $936 and close to the all-vehicle average of $652)
- Unscheduled repair frequency: 0.8 times per year (better than the full-size truck average of 0.9 times and significantly better than the all-vehicle average of 1.3 times)
- Probability of major repair: Lower than segment average, though specific percentage varies by model year

**Consumer Reports:** Consumer Reports expects that the 2025 Tundra will be **less reliable than the average new car**, with this prediction based on data from 2022, 2023, and 2024 models. The redesigned third-generation Tundra has experienced more initial quality issues than Toyota's typical standards, with some owners reporting concerns about engine problems, transmission issues, and electrical systems.

**Recalls:** The 2025 Toyota Tundra has been recalled 2 times by NHTSA, including one recall involving a software error that may cause the rearview image not to display when the vehicle is placed in reverse.

**Important Context:** The second-generation Tundra (2007-2021) earned an outstanding reputation for reliability, with many owners reporting trouble-free operation well beyond 200,000 miles. The current third-generation model (2022-present) represents a complete redesign with new engines, hybrid technology, and electronics. As with any all-new vehicle platform, reliability typically improves as Toyota addresses early issues through software updates and manufacturing refinements.

Toyota's strong dealer network, comprehensive warranty coverage (3-year/36,000-mile basic, 5-year/60,000-mile powertrain), and history of long-term durability continue to make the Tundra a competitive choice for buyers prioritizing dependability.
