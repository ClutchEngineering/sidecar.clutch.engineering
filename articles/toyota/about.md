# About Toyota

Toyota Motor Corporation was founded by Kiichiro Toyoda on August 28, 1937, in Toyota City, Japan. The company evolved from Toyoda Automatic Loom Works, a textile machinery manufacturer founded by Kiichiro's father, Sakichi Toyoda. This background in precision manufacturing and mechanical innovation laid the foundation for Toyota's approach to automobile production.

Toyota entered the American market in 1957 with the Toyopet Crown, though early attempts faced challenges. The company found success in the 1960s with the Corona and Corolla, vehicles designed specifically for export markets that emphasized reliability, fuel efficiency, and value. The Corolla, introduced in 1966, became one of the best-selling automobiles in history.

Toyota revolutionized manufacturing through the development of the Toyota Production System (TPS), also known as "lean manufacturing," which emphasized efficiency, quality control, and continuous improvement. This methodology, developed by engineer Taiichi Ohno in the decades following World War II, transformed global manufacturing practices and established Toyota's reputation for exceptional quality and reliability.
